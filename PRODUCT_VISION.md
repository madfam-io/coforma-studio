## 1. Mission Statement

Empower companies to **co-create with their customers** by transforming advisory boards into structured engines of growth, loyalty, and innovation.

---

## 2. The Problem We’re Solving

* Customer feedback today is fragmented (emails, surveys, random calls).
* Advisory boards exist, but they are ad-hoc, underutilized, and hard to scale.
* Companies struggle to turn insights into product-market fit and loyalty.
* Customers want a voice, recognition, and insider status — but lack structured ways to participate.

**Result:** Lost opportunities, wasted R\&D, high churn, and weak referral growth.

## 3. Our Vision

A world where every company runs **systematic, data-driven, community-powered advisory councils**.
Where **customers are not just buyers, but partners** in shaping the future of products and markets.

Coforma Studio is the **category leader of Advisory-as-a-Service (AaaS)**, enabling:

* **Companies** → to de-risk product decisions, accelerate PMF, and drive efficient growth.
* **Customers** → to feel ownership, gain recognition, and receive tangible benefits.
* **Markets** → to benefit from innovations that solve real problems collaboratively.

## 4. Guiding Principles

1. **Build with, not for** → Customers are partners, not data points.
2. **Trust by design** → Transparency, data integrity, and compliance as defaults.
3. **Win-Win-Win outcomes** → Balance value for company, customer, and market.
4. **Lightweight but powerful** → Simple UX that scales with integrations & automation.
5. **LATAM-rooted, globally fluent** → Design with LATAM’s relationship-first ethos, market globally with ROI clarity.

* **Scale:** Support 1,000+ tenants across LATAM, NA, and EU.
* **Ecosystem:** Create a facilitator marketplace + insights layer for aggregated trend reporting.
* **Innovation:** AI-assisted facilitation, semantic clustering of feedback, and predictive roadmap guidance.
