## Overview

Coforma Studio is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** designed to help companies create, manage, and scale **Customer Advisory Boards (CABs)**. By combining structured feedback loops, engagement hubs, and incentive mechanisms, it transforms CABs into **growth engines** that accelerate product-market fit, strengthen loyalty, and reduce customer acquisition costs.

Built with a **LATAM-first ethos** and designed for **global scalability**, Coforma Studio introduces a new category: **Advisory-as-a-Service (AaaS)**.

## Strategic Advantage

By building Coforma Studio, MADFAM both **improves its own product development cycle** and **creates a monetizable SaaS platform** for the wider market. The result is dual leverage: stronger internal innovation and recurring external revenues. This positions MADFAM as a **pioneer of Advisory-as-a-Service** and a **solarpunk innovation leader** in LATAM with global reach.
